# KetoDic
#### Website building project with Ubuntu server and Spring framework



- Vegetarian Diet was a huge trend for dieters over more than10 years. But nowadays **Ketogenic Diet** is taking their seat and has been spread as a new diet concept.
- The main idea of it is to replace most of the portion of carbon (not completely disallow it) in daily meals with **fat**, so our body slowly, but gradually changes to **Ketosis status**.
- Despite its increasing influence in South Korea, there is no such website that has proper information about '**which meal is considered ketogenic?**'. Many keto dieters get confused when they go out and face their meals. **'Is this ketogenic or not?'**
- So I have decided creating a website (could be developed as a mobile app later on) which functions as a dictionary that people can refer to, and also as a common place in which everyone can edit and leave a comment on every element.
